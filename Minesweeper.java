//The classic game re-made in a simple yet efficient class called Minesweeper. Don't worry, I'll try to explain what's happening
//The source code's length without comments was 120 lines long; not that it matters, but I like it efficient and short.

 //The first three arrays are the dimensions for beginner, intermediate, and expert; they're made final to prevent any possible change.
 //The array dimensions has the following indexes: [0] is the number of rows, [1] is the number of cols, and [2] number of bombs
 //The three boolean arrays: bombs, exposed, and flagged hold special information about wither and index is a bomb, or if it's flagged or exposed,
 //although dimensions is originally {0, 0, 0}, the three arrays are set to the dimensions to express the idea that later they will be set again to new dimensions.
 //Fun Fact: originally I had the three arrays part of a three-dimensional array, but they seemed confusing to people when I tried to explain the three-dimensional array.
 //The sol array will hold the "solution" of the game, in reality it jut holds the numbers that appear on screen
 //Boolean firstMove wasn't intended to be in the final version, but without it, many bugs arose and it's easier and more efficient to keep; against my wishes however...
